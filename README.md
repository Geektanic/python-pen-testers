Files made while going through a Udemy course "Python for Penetration Testers"

Web portal attack tutorial was basically just watching author go through some online platform
instead of writing code.  I made a file for it, but didn't write any code.

The last tutorial was finding non-beaconing wireless SSIDs.  I don't have a wireless NIC that
supports monitor mode, so I didn't write the code.
